To use this crate, specify use bbow::Bbow; at the top of your file.

I used the BTreeMap documentation extensively in the implementation of this project, those docs can be found here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html#method.entry.

I used AI to try and get some ideas, but did not end up using any of the AI code because the BTreeMap docs were more concise and more helpful.
